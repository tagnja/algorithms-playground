# Fractional Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

In **Fractional Knapsack**, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem.

```
Input:
  Items as (value, weight) pairs
  arr[] = {{60, 10}, {100, 20}, {120, 30}}
  Knapsack Capacity, W = 50;
Output :
   Maximum possible value = 240
   By taking full items of 10 kg, 20 kg and 
   2/3rd of last item of 30 kg
```
