# Shortest Common Supersequence

The shortest common supersequence (SCS) is the problem of finding the shortest supersequence Z of given sequences X and Y such that both X & Y are subsequences of Z.

For example, consider the two following sequences X and Y

X: ABCBDAB
Y: BDCABA

The length of SCS is 9
SCS are ABCBDCABA, ABDCABDAB and ABDCBDABA
