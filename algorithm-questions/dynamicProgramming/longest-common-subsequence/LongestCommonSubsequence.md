# Longest Common Subsequence

The problem differs from problem of finding common substrings. Unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.



For example, consider the two following sequences X and Y

X: ABCBDAB
Y: BDCABA


The length of LCS is 4
LCS are BDAB, BCAB and BCBA
